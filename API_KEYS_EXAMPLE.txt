## Security Best Practices

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Never share your API keys with anyone!

- API keys are stored locally on your Mac using UserDefaults
- Keys are never sent to TocoAce servers (we don't have any!)
- Keys are only used to make direct API calls to Anthropic/OpenAI
- Keep your keys secure and rotate them regularly

## Billing & Usage Limits

### Anthropic
- Set up billing at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing
- Monitor usage in the console
- Set spending limits to avoid unexpected charges

### OpenAI
- Add payment method at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- View usage at https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Set usage limits in account settings

## Recommended Starting Credits

For testing and initial use:
- **Light usage** (1-5 interviews): $5-10
- **Medium usage** (10-20 interviews): $20-30
- **Heavy usage** (50+ interviews): $50+

## API Key Format Examples

```
# Anthropic Claude
sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# OpenAI
sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Troubleshooting

### "API key not configured" error
- Make sure you've entered the key in Settings
- Check that the key starts with the correct prefix
- Verify there are no extra spaces

### "Authentication failed" error
- Key may be invalid or expired
- Regenerate your key in the respective console
- Check your account has active billing

### "Rate limit exceeded" error
- You've made too many requests too quickly
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Consider upgrading your API plan

### "Insufficient credits" error
- Add more credits/payment method to your account
- Check your billing status in the console

## Multiple API Keys (Advanced)

You can have both Anthropic and OpenAI keys configured:
- Switch between engines in Settings
- This gives you flexibility and redundancy
- Useful if one service is down or rate-limited

## Cost Estimation

Typical TocoAce usage:
- Resume analysis: ~500-2000 tokens (input)
- Job description: ~200-1000 tokens (input)
- Question transcription: ~50-200 tokens (input)
- Generated answer: ~50-200 tokens (output)

**Total per answer**: ~800-3400 tokens mixed

With Claude 3.5 Sonnet:
- Cost per answer: ~$0.01-0.05
- 20 interviews × 10 questions each = 200 answers
- Total cost: ~$2-10 for 20 interviews

Much cheaper than the $7.99 per interview in-app purchase! 🎯

**Note**: API costs are separate from TocoAce subscription fees. You pay:
1. TocoAce: For the app access (free trial, per-interview, or subscription)
2. Anthropic/OpenAI: For the AI API usage (pay-as-you-go based on actual usage)
